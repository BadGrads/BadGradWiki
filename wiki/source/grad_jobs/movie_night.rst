Movie Night Coordinator
=============================

Movie Night is a semi-monthly gathering with screenings of astronomy or space-themed films and free pizza, snacks, and soda. The primary responsibility of the Movie Night Overlord is to screen a movie every other week (usually in Campbell 131) and send an email to the Movie Night mailing list informing them of what movie is going to be screened. Also, posters are to be made and put up before each movie night, pizza and other food is to be ordered, and reimbursements submitted (food is funded by the department). Further, at the beginning of each semester, a semester movie schedule is be selected, a corresponding semester movie poster is to be created, and the budget for the semester is to be agreed upon with the department.

(As of 2015/2016, a couple of movie nights were organized by various department members throughout the year, going out to a movie as a group, or presenting them with the projector in room 131, or presenting them using the 9-panel display on the 3rd floor. However, the regular movie nights were retired after 2015/2016 and weren't revived until 2018/2019.)
