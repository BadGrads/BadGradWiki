UCB Astronomy Outreach Committee
========================================

The outreach coordinator's main job is to run and organize the two biggest public outreach events the department participates in, Bay Area Science Festival (at AT&T Park in San Francisco), and Cal Day (UC Berkeley campus). This involves handling the logistics with the actual event organizers, and gathering volunteers to help. Note, Astro Night is now so large it has it's own coordinator, but the Outreach Coordinators can also help with the Astro Night coordinator as needed.

There are many other smaller outreach events throughout the year that the outreach coordinators organize, depending on availability and interest (of both the department and the public). Some examples include but are not limited to public talks at the Berkeley Public Library, elementary school department visits, and talks to Bay Area astronomy clubs.

Anybody in the department can come up with outreach events beyond the regularly scheduled ones– Astro Night began this way. The outreach coordinators are more than happy to help members of the department advertise and organize the outreach events they want to host.
