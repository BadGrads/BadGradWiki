Small Council Representatives
==============================

The small council was created in Fall 2015 by (the then-brand-new department chair)
Eugene Chiang. The small council is a group of people who work to keep lines of communication open between all
of the different occupants of Campbell Hall.

Each major component of the department is represented by at least one person.
The group meets all together with the department chair more-or-less monthly
to talk about department-wide issues, disseminate information, and share
issues of concern. As of 2015/2016, in addition to the chair, the council
included the faculty member responsible as the head grad student adviser,
the faculty member responsible as the head undergrad student adviser,
an undergraduate major, a post-doc, and someone from the administrative staff.

The responsibilities of the Small Council representative are to attend these meetings,
to present the discussions from those meetings to the rest of the graduate students when
they are relevant to the whole student body, and to act as a conduit of information and
discussion between the students and the others at the small council meetings. This job
replaces the Faculty Representative job.

The Small Council representative is also tasked with running the yearly Fall Jobs
meeting (see the old Faculty Representative description for some advice on how to
do that). It is a responsibility of the chair (and the head graduate advisor) to
choose a student that will take on this role. (It's not like the other graduate
student jobs in this regard.)
