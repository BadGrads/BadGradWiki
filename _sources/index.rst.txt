BadGrad Wiki
============

Welcome to **BadGradWiki**: the community-maintained knowledge base for graduate
students in the **UC Berkeley Astronomy Department**.

This site collects practical knowledge, shared experience, and institutional
memory to help grads navigate the department, the PhD program, and life in Berkeley.
It also serves as a central home for resources related to departmental roles,
teaching, and other core aspects of the graduate student experience.

Here you’ll find information on graduate student jobs, advice from more senior
students, and resources that are useful to current and prospective grads alike.

.. note::

   This wiki is maintained by graduate students, for graduate students. It does **not**
   represent official department or university policy. For authoritative guidance,
   please consult departmental or UC Berkeley resources.
