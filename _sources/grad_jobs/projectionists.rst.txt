Colloquium Projectionists
==================================

The department projectionist makes sure that the weekly colloquium speakers can project their talks. This involves getting and setting up the projector (if there isn't one already in the room where the talk is to be held), ensuring the speaker is setup with a microphone before the talk, maintaining the laser pointers, and asking the speaker at tea if there's anything they need. (Note: the laser pointer requires 1.5V alkaline batteries, NOT rechargeable batteries (they don't have enough voltage). You can use the alkaline batteries in the bag). The projectionists should also bring an extra projector (and assorted equipment, if available) to colloquium. Finally, it is the responsibility of outgoing projectionists to train the incoming projectionists. This requires weekly work (just before colloquium) and is usually held by two first year students per semester.
