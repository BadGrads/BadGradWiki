Teaching
========

Graduate Student Instructors (GSIs) play a crucial role in the academic mission of the
University of California, Berkeley. They are responsible for leading discussion sections,
grading assignments, holding office hours, and providing valuable feedback to students.
All graduate students in the department are expected to serve as GSIs for at least two semesters
during their time in the program (save for certain fellowship recipients and other special cases). On this page,
you can find a number of resources regarding teaching as a GSI in our department.
